# render.yaml
# Deployment configuration for Render
#
# Your bot runs as a simple Python service.
# Although GitHub Actions is your scheduler, this Render service
#   - hosts the bot environment
#   - allows manual triggering
#   - provides secret storage
#
# IMPORTANT:
# If you ever want Render to run scheduled jobs instead of GitHub Actions,
# you can convert this to a 'cron job' service. For now, it stays as a web service.
